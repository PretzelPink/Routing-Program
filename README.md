Project Summary
-----------------
The Western Governors University Parcel Service (WGUPS) needs to determine an efficient route and delivery distribution for their daily local deliveries (DLD) because packages are not currently being consistently delivered by their promised deadline. The Salt Lake City DLD route has three trucks, two drivers, and an average of 40 packages to deliver each day. Each package has specific criteria and delivery requirements that are listed in the attached “WGUPS Package File.”

The Students task is to determine an algorithm, write code, and present a solution where all 40 packages will be delivered on time while meeting each package’s requirements and keeping the combined total distance traveled under 140 miles for all trucks. The specific delivery locations and distances to each location are given in the attached “WGUPS Distance Table.” The intent is to use the program for this specific location and also for many other cities in each state where WGU has a presence.

For this project I implemented the nearest neighbor search algorithm to determine the next closest address for each available truck to travel. The program uses object oriented python to manage packages and trucks which are assigned for delivery based on closest package first. The solution could be further improved by implementing dijkstras algorithm or adding a more complicated search algorithm.
